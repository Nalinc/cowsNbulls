It is a game with numbers that may date back a century or more. 
It is played by two opponents. 
The game can also be played with 3 digits instead of 4.
On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. 
The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the players try to
guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the 
matching digits are on their right positions, they are "bulls", if on different positions, they are "cows". Example:
Secret number: 4271
Opponent's try: 1234
Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)

The first one to reveal the other's secret number wins the game.
